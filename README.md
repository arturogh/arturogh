# My Blog

Where I'll talk about my adventures in UX land and capturing stories through photography.

This Jekyll blog is based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. This in turn is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
