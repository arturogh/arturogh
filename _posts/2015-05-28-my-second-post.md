<p>I'm a big proponent of defending your hobby. If there is something you love doing, why give it away? What I mean is, why give away the fun and passion you have doing it by starting to do it just for money and work?</p>
<p>Personally, photography is just too valuable for me. When I'm out shooting in the city or a beach maybe, inmediately I'm lost in the moment and just disappear into "photo" mode. I'm not thinking, just feeling and sensing. Without really noticing it, I disect what I see, compose photos in my head, rome around, climb, run. I escape and have TONS of fun. It's fantastic!</p>
<p>It makes me happy and fills my energy "gas tank". So, it's not just happiness, it actually helps me be better in the other aspects of my life. And it does because I haven't given away control over it, and so can have fun and be passionate about doing it. Because when you can't do it for fun, then, well you just gave away the fun!</p>
<p>I have nothing against winning money from your hobby. I do sell my photos for instance. What's really important though, is to never stop getting that fulfillment from what you love doing. It is just too valuable to lose!</p>
<p>Defend your hobby! It can really be something awesome.
