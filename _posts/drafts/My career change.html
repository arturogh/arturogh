<p>2008: I wasn’t sure what to study. Computer science had been on my mind, but it didn’t convince me. Since I was a small boy, I had always <em>loved</em> computers. But, for some reason, I imagined myself just sitting behind a computer in a cubicle, doing bring stuff. In my head, though computers were awesome, a computer job probably was, well, like a job. Here’s the thing: I didn’t even consider a thing like design might exist back then.</p>

<p>So, I ended up studying the ‘obvious’ choice (job-wise): industrial engineering. Several cousins of mine had studied it and were then quite happily employed.</p>
