If you’re an expert outdoor sports-person, it’s tough to find people or groups you can join to practice what you love. That’s the inspiration behind this:

Untamed - Mobile app
Problem and goal: outdoor lovers don’t have an easy way to connect with each other to organise and discover trips. We strive to connect them and enrich their experience.
There are no tailored solutions for this. There seems to be an audience (needs validation), so it’s an opportunity worth looking into. It provides (pending validation) very useful and quick information/functions.
Role: Interviewer and designer

Steps:
Interview
processed (cleaned) interview
affinity diagram
further questions
persona
5Ws and 1H
project summary
scenario
prototype
user activity diagram (Notability, needs more work and redoing in Keynote)



Results:
A prototype (to be redone in Sketch + with more thinking) that will serve to explore further if the app is useful/has a market. Maybe they like it, but would they pay for it? Use there an opportunity to monetise it? Explore (ads, store in app, sponsors, etc). Maybe REI can sponsor the app, so we can validate too if there would be a demand and use of a free alternative.

The problem was (in theory) solved because people are now able to post trips for people to go, make the whole communication and coordination easy and can find valuable information on other places.

Most surprising: that there isn’t an option already. That it is hard to meet fellow rock climbers, hikers, etc.

If you already have a group, you might no be interested. Opportunity: how can we tailor the app FOR them too, so it is a tool they can use. What do they use TODAY?

Most important things learned:
it is easy to get biased doing an interview (I focused and went deeper on just a part of the interview: that he errs on the side of comfort)
doing a paper prototype is not the best alternative
examples used during the presentation should be the same throughout.
