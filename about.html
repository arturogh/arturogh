<div class="-bio">
	<p>But first a father and a husband. Priorities, right?</p>
  <p>My strengths are understanding and analyzing user data and turning that into useful outputs via interfaces, user flows or defining the experience for a site. I'm also a competent web developer (HTML, CSS, Sass and some jQuery).</p>
  <p>Originally I studied industrial engineering in Lima, Per√∫, but a couple of years after graduating and learning web development and design on my own, I made the switch (the big career change!). I joined an education non-profit with a web development wing called <a href="http://laboratoria.la">Laboratoria</a>. Now, I'm studying a 10 week course in General Assembly in Seattle to consolidate my skills and have a solid foundation on which to grow on this new career path.</p>
