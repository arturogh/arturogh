<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> There are more places, good ones too. But these are my absolute favourite ones. If you don't see one worthy of this list, do hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/arturogoicochea">twitter</a> please!</p>

<p>Also worthwhile mentioning, I like my coffee interesting and super flavourfoul, usually on the fruity side. I also appreciate what you could call weird flavors (but in a good way). In that sense, the first 2 places on the list are my favourite by a slight margin.</p>

<p>So, in order or preference:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<!-- <img src="neptune"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://neptunecoffee.com">Neptune Coffee</a></strong> <em>in Greenwood.</em></h3>
<p>The craziest flavours, period. Most consistent quality on each shot too. And, they pretty much change beans every few days, so you get something different frequently. They carry great pastries too and a few sandwiches. </p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="slate"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://www.slatecoffee.com">Slate</a></strong> <em>in Ballard.</em></h3>
<p>These guys love coffee and it shows. They have something called a deconstructed machiatto: an espresso shot + milk + a machiatto (3 drinks). Their coffee and flavours is also top notch. They roast their own beans and carry others too.</p>
</li>

<h3><strong><a href="http://elmcoffeeroasters.com">Elm</a></strong> <em>in Pioneer Square.</em></h3>
<p>Super nice place, very very consistently amazing coffee. Less surprising flavors than the first 2, but that doesn't make them any less awesome. No plugs here, so laptop bearers beware!</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="miir"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://miir.com">Miir</a></strong> <em>in Fremont.</em></h3>
<p>Amazing coffee, great beer selection, and on top of that, they are a non-profit doing amazing work: bikes, metal bottles and more. Your purchases helps people in Africa (moslty) and around the world.</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="milstead"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://milsteadandco.com">Milstead</a></strong> <em>in Fremont.</em></h3>
<p>Super nice folks who know how to work coffee. A decent selection of pastries too. They rotate the beans they use frequently as well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="street-bean"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://streetbeanespresso.org">Street Bean</a></strong> <em>in Belltown.</em></h3>
<p>The folks here are super nice! Maybe it's in part because they are an amazing non-profit helping "street involved youth" gain essential job skills by training them as baristas and roasters. So yes, they roast their own beans and also carry a great selection from other roasters. They always have great pastries too!</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="vif"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://vifseattle.com">Vif Coffee and Wine</a></strong> <em>in Fremont.</em></h3>
<p>Up in Fremont, this amazing place serves coffee, wine, cheese and a bunch of other tasty stuff. They carry Olympia Coffee (YES!) and are in an all glass wall location. Also, they have home-brewed chai if that's your thing. And...they also sell some gourmet stuff. </p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="victrola"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://www.victrolacoffee.com">Victrola</a></strong> <em>in Capitol Hill.</em></h3>
<p>They roast the beans in this location, have a neat selection of pastries and sandwiches and other beverages. If espresso is your thing, get the single origin one!</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="anchored"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Anchored-Ship-Coffee-Bar-117506641609920/">Anchored Ship</a></strong> <em>in Ballard.</em></h3>
<p>A super small shop carrying Counter Culture Beans and some pastries. They know their business. There are plenty of cool places around there too (bars and restaurants).</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="analog"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://analogcoffee.com">Analog Coffee</a></strong> <em>in Capitol Hill.</em></h3>
<p>Secluded and hard to find, but they have one of my favourite pour over coffee, with flavours that are deep, susprising and indeed varied.</p>
</li>

<h3><strong><a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com">Stumptown</a></strong> <em>in Capitol Hill.</em></h3>
<p>A big name, but they do live up to it. they have very consistent coffee, usually with a more conventional flavour. Some pastries offered too.</p>
</li>

<li>
<!-- <img src="storyville"> -->
<h3><strong><a href="http://storyville.com">Storyville</a></strong> <em>in Pike Place and more.</em></h3>
<p>They have really good coffee, but they have amazing pastries, made fresh, on the spot in their hidden kitches, every couple of hours. Their fols are also super happy all the time, and the cafes are mega cozy. They have mostky sofas though, with a few tables and some "bar" style tables + bench spaces.</p>
