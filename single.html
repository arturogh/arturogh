  <p class="intro">This is an introductory paragraph to this section. What do you think about it? I kind of like it. To get a true feel about the project, I think we ought to make this a little bit longer. This way we can see more stuff and be happy that we are finally working.</p>
  <h3 class="subtitle">The plan</h3>
  <p>We should put a little paragraph just after the title so it seems like we know what we are talking about, don't you think? Well, I do, so we shall! Onward!</p>

  <p>Do a few lines of text fit here? Let's see.</p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What kind?</h3>
  <p>
    I focus on IA, Interface design, and user resaerch, but know my way around more.
  </p>
  <h3>Tell me more about you?...</h3>
  <p>Originally an industrial engineer, I learned web development and design on my own. I worked at a web development agency as a product manager and ux designer and then got into General Assembly.</p>
  <h3>My best work</h3>
  <p>We should put a little paragraph just after the title so it seems like we know what we are talking about, don't you think? Well, I do, so we shall! Onward!</p>
  <h3>Lets put more titles here</h3>
  <p>This experience results in this story. I realised how much software we’re using influence our workflow logic. Right now we’re at the very exciting moment. Photoshop is getting old. It’s slow, its core code is heavily outdated and after all it was made as photo editor not interface design tool. Former champion became lazy and got fat. At the same time rebels appeared. But none of them is perfect.</p>
