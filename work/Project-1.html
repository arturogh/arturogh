<p class="intro">
  This project explores a desktop site by REI, separate from REI.com, that helps find camping trip destinations, as well as planning and buying gear for them.
</p>
<p class="intro">
  The premise is to help people “enjoy the great outdoors, purchase more products through REI, and become more involved in environmental stewardship” by building a Website that pushes (more) people to go on more camping trips together.
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Project Brief</h3>
<p>As detailed in the project brief, this site should enable users to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find and book camping destinations.</li>
  <li>Discover and book other outdoor activities to take
part in while camping.</li>
  <li>Plan the trip with a trip checklist.</li>
  <li>Receive intelligent suggestions for the checklist based on campers destination and activities.</li>
  <li>Purchase products available already on REI.com directly from
this new website.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="subtitle">Research</h3>
<p>The domain research focused on a paper on American camping, which provided important insights, such as that camping is a group activity done with friends or/and family, and that activities are an essential part of it.</p>
<p>After this, a comparative of sites with similar objectives to the ones this site has would later inform the fields, information and functionality each page should have.</p>
<p>With this data, I interviewed 5 people between the ages of 18 and 54. The key takeaways were “it’s really hard to find places to go camping to” and “It’s hard planning group camping trip”.</p>
