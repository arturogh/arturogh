<p class="intro">
  This project explores a desktop site by REI, separate from REI.com, that helps find camping trip destinations, as well as planning and buying gear for them, something that research made clear is complicated at the moment. Through a design process, I arrived at a smooth on rails experience that was succesfully tested with users.</p>

<h3 id="start" class="subtitle"><strong>Research</strong></h3>

<p>The first step was doing some domain research, which proved important in understanding camping (and campers) in America. For instance, key is knowing that camping is a group activity done with friends or/and family. A comparative analysis then providad a starting point for which fields, information and functionality each page in the site should have. With this data, I decided to interview people between the ages of 18 and 54. I did 5 interviews, the key takeaways from these being that “it’s really hard to find places to go camping to” and “It’s hard planning group camping trip”. I finished this phase by creating the persona for the project by way of an Affinity Diagram. The insights uncovered in this step would determine the design of the website.</p>

<p>Since this site needs to do multiple things well: find destinations, plan trips, and sell gear. This is why working on a complete user flow was essential in getting the system structure right. After this exercise I decided this would be an "on rails" experience. The first step would always be finding a destination, followed by starting to plan and buy gear later.</p>

<p>I worked on wireframes and used them to build a prototype with InVision, which I used for user testing with a friend who frequently goes camping.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle"><strong>Conclusion and Next Steps</strong></h3>
<p>The testing helped me verify the experience was clear. She was able to find a place to go to, add friends, book a place, manage activities and add gear to her list. The section she didn't find 100% straightforward was the search. This is something I would need to test with further users, as 1 user test is nevertheless not enough to conclude that the prototype </p>
