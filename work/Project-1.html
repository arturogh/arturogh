<p class="intro">
  This project explores a desktop site by REI, separate from REI.com, that helps find camping trip destinations, as well as planning and buying gear for them.
</p>
<p class="intro">
  The premise is to help people “enjoy the great outdoors, purchase more products through REI, and become more involved in environmental stewardship” by building a Website that pushes (more) people to go on more camping trips together.

<h3 id="start" class="subtitle">Research</h3>
<p>The first step for this phase was doing some domain research, which proved important in understanding camping (and campers) in America. For instance, key is knowing that camping is a group activity done with friends or/and family. A comparative analysis done next informed which fields, information and functionality each page in the site should have. Once I had this data, I interviewed 5 people between the ages of 18 and 54. The key takeaways from these interviews were “it’s really hard to find places to go camping to” and “It’s hard planning group camping trip”. All these insights were essential in designing the website later on.</p>
