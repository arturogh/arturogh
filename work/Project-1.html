<p class="intro">
  This project explores a desktop site by REI, separate from REI.com, that helps find camping trip destinations, as well as planning and buying gear for them.
</p>
<p class="intro">
  The premise is to help people “enjoy the great outdoors, purchase more products through REI, and become more involved in environmental stewardship” by building a Website that pushes (more) people to go on more camping trips together.

<h3 id="start" class="subtitle">Research</h3>
<img src="public/images/work-images/a-travel-planning-app/persona.jpg" alt="">
<p>The first step for this phase was doing some domain research, which proved important in understanding camping (and campers) in America. For instance, key is knowing that camping is a group activity done with friends or/and family. A comparative analysis done next informed which fields, information and functionality each page in the site should have. Once I had this data, I interviewed 5 people between the ages of 18 and 54. The key takeaways from these interviews were “it’s really hard to find places to go camping to” and “It’s hard planning group camping trip”, allowing also to create a persona for the project by way of an Affinity Diagram. All these insights were essential in designing the website later on.</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Design</h3>

<p>Having to find destinations, planning trips, and buying gear in the same site proved a challenge. This is why working on a complete user flow was essential in getting the system structure right. After this exercise I decided this would be an "on rails" experience. The first step would always be finding a destination, followed by starting to plan and buy gear later.</p>
<img src="public/images/work-images/a-travel-planning-app/wireframe.png" alt="">
<p>I worked on wireframes and used them to build a prototype with InVision, which I used for user testing with a friend who frequently goes camping. The testing helped me verify the experience was clear, as she was able to find a place to go to, add friends, book a place, manage activities and add gear to her list. </p>
